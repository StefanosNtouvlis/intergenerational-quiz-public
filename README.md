# Intergenerational-Quiz-public

This is the final GitHub repository linked to my Master Thesis, "Design and Evaluation of a Quiz Game to Support Intergenerational Social Connectedness". My name is Stefanos Ntouvlis, canditate for a MSc's Degree at the University of Amsterdam. In this simple github repository you can see a video showcasing a full user journey of the interactive UI that I created, as a prototype.
For further questions do not hesitate to contact me.

In the videos below, you can see the prototype game that was created for the thesis.
